**   Constructor. The creation of an event is initiated by the event builder,
**   whose identity is passed and saved by the event ("eb"). The builder
**   also provides the set of participants for this event ("contract"),
**   the packet which initiated the construction of the event ("packet"),
**   and the location in the pending queue ("after") at which the event
**   should insert itself. the packet will be used to determine the
**   sequence number of the event. Note, that the event keeps a (single)
**   linked list of each packet contribution. This list doubles as the
**   DMA list passed to the Universe's DMA engine.
